 *         shields.                                                        *

 * In d20/Dungeons and Dragons, special abilities are what make magic      *
 * items -magical-.  These abilities, being wreathed in fire, exploding    *
 * with frost on a critical hit etc. are part of what defineds D&D.        *
 *                                                                         *
 * In order to implement these thing in LuminariMUD, some additions to the *
 * stock object model have been made (in structs.h).  These changes allow  *
 * the addition of any number of the defined special abilities to be added *
 * to the weapon, armor or shield in addition to any APPLY_ values that    *
 * the object has.  Additionally, an activation method must be defined.    *
 *                                                                         *
 * The code is defined similarly to the spells and commands in stock code, *
 * in that macros and an array of structures are used to define new        *
 * special abilities.                                                      *
